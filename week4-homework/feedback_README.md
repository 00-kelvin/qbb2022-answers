This is a great start! You're well on your way to completing the assignment.

1. Your PCA plot looks great (and the `plink` command is correct), but I don't see your code to actually make the plot (-0.5 point)
2. I have the `plink` command you used to get allele frequencies, but I don't see your AF plot or the code for it (-1 point)
3. Your manhattan plot code looks almost right, I think you just need to find a way to deal with the covariates in the output of running `plink` (theres a `TEST` column that should help you with this) You also need to somehow mark the significant SNPs. And then don't forget to upload the actual manhattan plots! (-1 point)
4. We still need your boxplot and code, and your answer for question 7 (-2.5)

Great work so far!
