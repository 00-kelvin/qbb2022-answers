### Question 2.2

The quantiles of the sample p-values generally fall well below the expected/theoretical quantiles of the uniform distribution, indicating that the p-values in the sample skew low. A straight line across the diagonal would indicate that the p-values follow a uniform distribution, and thus the null hypothesis cannot be rejected; p-values that skew low indicate that there is some differential expression going on -- that is, there is some association between stage and fpkm values that is showing up in the regressions as low p-values.

### Question 2.6

The percentage overlap is 90.99540581929556
