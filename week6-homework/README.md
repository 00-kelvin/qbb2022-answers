# Week 6 Homework

## Part 1: Getting, Exploring, and Commenting on the HiCPro analysis results

**What percentage of reads are valid interactions (duplicates do not count as valid)?**

* For the dCTCF data, 37.8% of read pairs are valid interaction pairs, and 92% of those "valid pairs" are "valid interactions" (not duplicates), which means ~34.8% of the reads are valid interactions.
* For the ddCTCF data, 36.6% of read pairs are valid interaction pairs, and 88% of those "valid pairs" are "valid interactions" (not duplicates), which means ~32.2% of the reads are valid interactions.
