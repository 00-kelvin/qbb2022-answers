1. Great job with the annotation! Again, very easy to read with your use of whitespace between different code blocks (I do this as well for my own code). I also approve of cutting off lines at a certain number of characters so that it doesn't get super long - some computer science courses will force you to do this to instill good readability practices.

2. Also great work with the dbSNP ID matching script! Isn't it interesting (or expected, maybe?) that the majority of SNPs discovered in the 1000 Genomes data are already known dbSNP variants?
