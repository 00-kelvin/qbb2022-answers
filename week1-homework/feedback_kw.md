# Week 1 Genome Assembly -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 points out of 10 possible points

1. Question 1.1, 1.4 how many reads (0.5 pts each)

  * good --> +1

2. Question 1.2, 1.4 simulation script(s)

  * good work on setting a random seed to make it reproducible
  * very good use of `np.random.randint`
  * Is there a way you could set your `x` variable referring to `coverage` rather than looking at the plot to figure out the upper bound? Think about the `np.max` function
  * consider making a function that you call twice (once for 5x, once for 15x) instead of having repetitive code
  * wonderful job --> +1

3. Question 1.2, 1.4 plotting script(s)

  * great! --> +1

4. Question 1.2, 1.4 histograms with overlaid Poisson distributions (0.5 pts each)

  * very nice plots! --> +1

5. Question 1.3, 1.4 how much of genome not sequenced/comparison to Poisson expectations (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * very good! --> +1

6. Question 2 De novo assembly (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * number of contigs --> +0.5
  * total length of contigs --> +0.5

7. Question 2 De novo assembly cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * size of largest contig --> +0.5
  * contig n50 size --> +0.5; very good explanation

8. whole genome alignment (0.33 pts each, 0.33/2 for answer and 0.33/2 for code)

  * average identity --> +0.33
  * length of longest alignment --> +0.33
  * how many insertions and deletions in assembly --> +0.33

9. decoding the insertion (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * position of insertion in assembly --> +0.5
  * length of novel insertion --> +0.5

10. decoding the insertion cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * DNA sequence of encoded message --> +0.5
  * secret message --> +0.5

Great work! Wonderful explanations and recording of code
