# Week 1 Homework

## Exercise 1

### Question 1: Coverage Simulator

#### Question 1.1

1 Mbp genome x 5x coverage = 5 Mbp of data

5 Mbp / 100 bp reads = 50,000 reads

For 15x coverage, 150,000 reads

#### Question 1.3

In the 5x coverage simulation, 6953 bp were not sequenced. This is comparable to the Poisson expectations, which I calculated in my script to be 6737.946999085467.

#### Question 1.3

In the 15x coverage simulation, 3 bp were not sequenced. The Poisson expectation was that only 0.3059023205018258 bp would not be sequenced, so 3 is quite close to this expectation of basically no missed bp.
