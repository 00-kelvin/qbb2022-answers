3. The relationship between maternal age and maternally inherited de novo mutations is significant: p = 6.878208e-24 < 0.05. The size of the relationship can be quantified by looking at the slope of the line (0.3776). For every additional year of maternal age, we can expect 0.3776 additional de novo maternally inherited mutations.
4. The relationship between paternal age and paternally inherited de novo mutations is significant: p = 1.552294e-84 < 0.05. The size of the relationship can be quantified by looking at the slope of the line (1.3538). For every additional year of paternal age, we can expect 1.3538 additional de novo paternally inherited mutations.
6. According to the t-test, the number of maternally inherited de novo mutations per proband is significantly different than the number of paternally inherited de novo mutations per proband: t = 53.4, p = 2.20e-264 < 0.05.
7. A proband with a father who was 50.5 years old at the probandâ€™s time of birth is predicted to have 78.018535 paternally inherited de novo mutations.
