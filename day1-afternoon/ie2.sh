#goal: number of SNPs in the 1000 genomes file that intersect each gene and how many unique genes are represented

genefile=/Users/cmdb/data/bed_files/genes.bed
vcffile=/Users/cmdb/data/vcf_files/random_snippet.vcf

bedtools intersect -a $genefile -b $vcffile > intersect_out_ie2.bed

# in terminal: 
# cut -f 4 intersect_out_ie2.bed | sort | uniq | wc -l 
# output: 166 (number of unique genes with SNPs)
